Changes to CANGC1e firmware for version 2e

- Build options so also supports MERG CANEther hardware
- CBUS parameter block to latest CBUS spec, supported by RQNPN command (backwards compatible)
- CAN bootloader supported and tested (have to bootload via another PC interface module)
- Parse all CBUS commands regardless of which interface they arrive on - so can also now configure via CAN from another PC interface
- Any responses transmitted by CANGC1e/CANEther now sent to Ethernet and CAN
- All CBUS messages arriving from a CBUS node connected by Ethernet are relayed to all other Ethernet nodes as well as to CAN.
- Add some software debounce to the pushbutton, to fix problem of sometimes jumping into setup mode if there is a spike
- CBUS node number assignment sequence is now CBUS and FCU compatible when JP2/LK1 is fitted, it still works the old way if the link is removed.
- Added support for RQMN opcode with response of NAME
- Fixed a problem with incorrect DLC length byte when sending some opcodes - did not matter before as these opcodes were only sent by gridconnect,
  but matters now as these are also tranmisttted via CAN.
- Writes of Node Variables are acknowledged by WRACK  
- When DHCP IP address assignment is selected by powering up with the button in, this setting now sticks and the NV flag is changed.
  The setting and flag can be toggled back by powering up with the button in again.
- When assinging IP address using DHCP, the host name "CBUS" is sent to the DHCP server. 
  This shows up in the listing on the router so you can see which IP address has been assigned.






Detailed source file changes

Link control file

18f2585.lkr	- Added CBUS parameter block definition at fixed address

Assembler source files

boot4.asm	- Change referred user vectors to 0x800 upwards for FCU compatibility


C header files

cbusdefs8d.h	- Replaces cbusdefs.h for latest spec compatibility

cangc1e.h	- Add #if directives so can be built for CANGC1e or CANEther.
		- Define manufacturer, module type, name and default NN for CANEther
		- Define additional parameters used in latest CBUS parameter block
		- Define pushbutton software debounce count
		
gcaeth.h	- Modified definition of CBusEthBroadcast, see notes below in gcaeth.c	

io.h		- Added definition of outputs for yellow/green CBUS leds fitted to CANEther

project.h	- Define additional parameters used in latest CBUS parameter block

TCPIPConfig.h	- Change default host name to "CBUS"
		- Set default MAC address to include major, minor version number and build number in last 3 bytes

DHCP.h		- Change length of DHCP parameter list to not request host name (we send it)



C source files

All modules which include the CBUS opcode defintions file have been updated to use the latest version

c018i.c		- Set code entry to 0x800 as per boot4.asm

cangc1e.c	- Define CBUS parameter block as per current spec
		- User vectors defined at 0x800 upwards
		- Add debounce counter for pushbutton
		- Add parse CBUS commands that arrive via CAN
		- Add parameter to calls to CBusEthBroadcast (see below)
		
commands.c	- parseCmdEth is now also used to parse commands when they arrive via CAN.
		- Add code to work out frame type on commands received via CAN.
		- Add parameter to calls to CBusEthBroadcast (see below)
		- Add outputs to Green and Yellow LEDs on CANEther
		- Change response to SNN for CBUS compatibility - still works the old way
		  if JP2/LK1 is not fitted.
		- Add support for opcode RQMN with response opcode NAME
		- Enable BOOT opcode as this now works when bootloaded via anohter PC interface
		- Fix incorrect dlc message length byte in NVRD
		- Add writes of Node Variables are acknowledged by a WRACK command
		- RQNPN opcode supports additional parameters, index 0 returns number of parameters supported.
		- Add correct CANID in transmission of RQNPN (was missing)
		
eth.c		- Add definition of host name
		- Change startup behaviour so When DHCP IP address assignment is selected by powering up with
		  the button in, this setting now sticks and the NV flag is changed. The setting and flag can
		  be toggled back by powering up with the button in again.

gcaeth.c	- Add parameter to calls to CBusEthBroadcast (see below)
		- CBusEthBroadcast now transmits packet to CAN and to all connected Ethernet nodes
		- Added a parameter to CBusEthBroadcast to exclude a given socket, so it does not transmit back
		  to the node that sent the packet. See comments in source file for full details.
		  
io.c		- Add initialisation of outputs for yellow/green CBUS leds fitted to CANEther
		- Added flash of yellow LED on CANEther during setup mode
		
DHCP.c		- Add code to send hostname to server when getting IP address by DHCP
