# CANEther
CBUS to Ethernet module firmware

This firmware is used on the CANEther CBUS module which provides a bridge from CAN to Ethernet for CBUS.

The firmware runs on the Microchip PIC18 series using the C18 compiler. It uses the Microchip ELA TCP/IP libraries.

Those libraries are distributed under a Microchip license that allows them to be freely used on Microchip hardware only.

The CANEther source code is derived from the Rocrail CANGC1e source code, originally by Rob Versluis, and released under the 
GNU public license.

Backwards compatibility with the CANGC1e has been maintained with all enhancements made to the firmware.

Any MERG specific source and header files used are distrubuted under the Creative Commons sharealike non-commercial license.

The heading for each source and header file describes the applicable license.

The Master currently reflects rev 2eBETA13.

There is an active branch working on changes for rev 2eBETA14.
